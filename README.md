# Library Management System
This project implements a Library Management System using JavaFX for the graphical user interface (GUI) and 
backend logic implemented in Java. It allows users to perform various library-related tasks such as adding 
and removing books and members, checking out books, returning books, searching for books and members, 
and viewing statistics.

## How to Run
